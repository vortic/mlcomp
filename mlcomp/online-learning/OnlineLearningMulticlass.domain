kind: interactive-learning
taskDescription: |-
  The goal of this task is to learn how to classify data points represented as real vectors into one of K classes.
datasetDescription: |-
  The datashard is presented one at a time. The feature vector is presented first, through STDIN:
  <pre>
  featureIndex:featureValue ... featureIndex:featureValue
  </pre>
  where featureIndex is a positive integer and featureValue is a real number. 
  The program should output to STDOUT its prediction:
  <pre>
  predicted-output
  </pre>
  where predicted-output element of {1, 2, ..., K}. The program does not know there are K classes, and it must find out through experience.
  Once prediction is received, the correct label is presented through STDIN:
  <pre>
  correct-label
  </pre>
  where correct-label element of {1, 2, ..., K}.
