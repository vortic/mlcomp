  This programs is part of the WEKA classifier library. The code used to generate this program is from the java class 'weka/classifiers/lazy/KStar.java' from WEKA's libraries.
  
  The following description was taken from this classes JavaDoc information:

  K* is an instance-based classifier, that is the class of a test instance is based upon the class of those training instances similar to it, as determined by some similarity function.  It differs from other instance-based learners in that it uses an entropy-based distance function.
  
  For more information on K*, see

  NOTE: This algorithm has no parameter tuning, it is using the default WEKA parameters<br/><br/>
  
  
  NOTE: WEKA's Classifiers read a data in the .arff format. For Multiclass datasets, the SVMlight format converted to .arff multiclass format so they can be read by WEKA programs
